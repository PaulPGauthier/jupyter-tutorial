    "\n",
    "The last three operators above are _exponent_ (raise to the power of), _modulo_ (divide and return remainder) and _floor division_. Be careful that the division operator behaves differently in legacy Python 2: it rounds to an integer when the operands are integers. We use Python 3 and don't worry about this, because it gives the expected result, e.g., `1/2` gives `0.5` (not zero!).\n",

In science, the two libraries that first made Python useful were **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.\n",
